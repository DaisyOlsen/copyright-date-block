# Copyright Date Block

This is a very simple WordPress block plugin that utilized both a `render.php` file as well as a `save.js` file. On the frontend, the `render.php` file takes precendence, but if the plugin is ever disabled, the `save.js` file serves as a fallback so a copyright date is still displayed.
